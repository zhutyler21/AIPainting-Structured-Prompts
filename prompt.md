Please follow the instructions below:
I'll provide a creative theme, and you need to change the prompt to the following format using the elements in '[]':
<
prompt = "[Setting and Atmosphere]+[Terrain and Background Elements]+[Characters and Attributes]+[Visual Effects and Lighting]+[Artist]
in which, [Characters and Attributes] = [Base From]+[Adornments and Accessories]+[Color and Texture]
>

Here are the specific requirements of theme and elements:
<
- Theme: 
- Setting and Atmosphere: 
- Terrain and Background Elements:
    + Background: 
- Characters and Attributes:
    + Base Form: 
    + Adornments and Accessories: 
    + Color and Texture: 
- Visual Effects and Lighting:
    + Lighting: 
- Artist: 
>

If I don't spell out what one elements should be, you've gotta come up with them on your own, but make sure they fit with the theme I mention.
Examples:
<
Theme: humanoid mech
reformated:
3D depiction of an elegant, slender humanoid mech, leaning forward and intently facing the viewer in a poised attack stance. The mech is adorned with mechanical roses, enhancing its grace. Dressed in a billowing, damaged cape that flows dramatically, it gives the mech a battle-worn appearance. The mech wields an elegant long sword, with the shield removed. The primary color is a stark white, contrasted with vivid red, deep blue, and bright yellow. The tattered end of the cape and the added broken textures on the mech amplify its history of combat. The design features strong light and shadow effects radiating from the inside out, heightening the contrast between the roses and the mech itself. All of this is portrayed in a dark, gothic art style.

Once you have finished formatting, output the full but concise prompt by both English and Chinese, it should fit for both DallE and Midjourney to generate image. 
Don't keep the [] or + symbols in prompt.

Then,confirm that for me, and i will tell you to generate image or not.

Do you understand? Please read carefully and start working.
